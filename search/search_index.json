However, in a local installation where the user has rights to install in the system directories (e.g. in a Conda environment with R) the user installation directory is not created automatically. Open an R session in an interactive session in the HPC cluster or in your personal machine. To get the location where user packages are installed call <pre><code>&gt; Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\")\n[1] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\n</code></pre> which will print an environment variable, <code>R_LIBS_USER</code>, which is set by R and stores the default location for storing user packages. If you create the directory with <pre><code>$ mkdir -p /home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\n</code></pre> then you can print the locations where R is searching for packages (after reloading R), and the default location should appear first in the list. For instance for o Conda installation of R using the Micromamba package manager, the paths printed are <pre><code>&gt; .libPaths()\n[1] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\n[2] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/micromamba/envs/R/lib/R/library\"\n</code></pre> where R is installed in a Conda environment named <code>R</code> in the second entry of the search path.</p> <p>There are now multiple locations where packages are stored. The location used by default is the first in the list. Thus, after creating the default location for user installed packages, packages are installed by default in user wide mode. For instance, installing the Packrat package, <pre><code>&gt; install.packages(c(\"packrat\"))\n</code></pre> listing the user installation directory <pre><code>$ ls \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\npackrat\n</code></pre> will show the directory with the installed Packrat package files. To install the package in a system wide installation, use the <code>lib</code>flag <pre><code>&gt; install.packages(c(\"packrat\"), lib=\"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/micromamba/envs/R/lib/R/library\")\n</code></pre> to specify the installation location. During loading, all directories in the path are searched consecutively until the package is located.</p> <p>The package installation paths can also be used to maintain multiple independent environments in R. For instance, you can maintain a personal environment and project environment for your research group. Lets consider the case where you want the create an environment in a project directory. First, create a directory for the R environment <pre><code>$ mkdir -p \"${PROJECTHOME}&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\"\n</code></pre> where the variable <code>PROJECTHOME</code> is defined in the UL HPC system environment to point to the home of the project directories (and includes a trailing slash '/'). To install a package in the project environment, call the installation function with the appropriate <code>lib</code> argument <pre><code>&gt; install.packages( c(\"packrat\"), lib=paste0( Sys.getenv(\"PROJECTHOME\"), \"&lt;project name&gt;/\", \"R-environment\" ) )\n</code></pre> and follow the typical instructions. To load the package, you now must also specify the location of the library, <pre><code>&gt; library( packrat, lib.loc=paste0( Sys.getenv(\"PROJECTHOME\"), \"&lt;project name&gt;/\", \"R-environment\" ) )\n</code></pre> similar to the installation. Environment options can be used to extent the library paths and avoid having to specify the library path in each command.</p> <p>A startup file mechanism is provided by R to set up user and project wide environment options. There are 2 kinds of file,</p> <ul> <li><code>.Renviron</code> files used to set-up environment variables for R, and</li> <li><code>.Rprofile</code> files used to run any R code during initialization.</li> </ul> <p>Note that <code>.Renviron</code> files are simply a list of <pre><code>key=value\n</code></pre> assignment pairs which are read by R, not proper bash code (adding an <code>export</code> modifier is a syntax error). There are 2 locations where startup files appear,</p> <ul> <li>the home directory, <code>~/.Renviron</code> and <code>~/.Rprofile</code>, for user wide settings, and</li> <li>project directories for project wide settings.</li> </ul> <p>The definitions in project <code>.Rprofile</code> files override the user wide definitions in <code>~/.Rprofile</code>. The definitions in <code>.Renviron</code> files supersede the definitions in <code>~/.Renviron</code>, that is if the project has an environment file, the user wide definitions are ignored. Note that R is designed to source setup files at the directory where R starts, and any setup files in parent or descendent directories are ignored.</p> <p>Both the profile and environment startup files can setup a user wide environment. For instance, to use an environment setup in the project directories of the UL HPC systems add in the user wide environment setup file, <code>~/.Renviron</code>, the entry <pre><code>R_LIBS=${PROJECTHOME}&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\n</code></pre> and then reload R.

Note that the setup file options precede any default options.</p> <p>We can also use startup files to setup project wide libraries. For instance, assume that we are working on a project in a directory named <code>project</code> and the R packages are stored in a subdirectory <code>R-environment</code>. We use a project profile, to still be able to use any library paths defined in the user wide environment file. Add in a file <code>project/.Rprofile</code> the following definitions, <pre><code>project_path &lt;- paste0( getwd(), \"/R-environment\" )\nnewpaths &lt;- c( project_path, .libPaths() )\n.libPaths( newpaths )\n</code></pre> and then start R in the <code>project</code> directory.

However, in a local installation where the user has rights to install in the system directories (e.g. in a Conda environment with R) the user installation directory is not created automatically. Open an R session in an interactive session in the HPC cluster or in your personal machine. To get the location where user packages are installed call <pre><code>&gt; Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\")\n[1] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\n</code></pre> which will print an environment variable, <code>R_LIBS_USER</code>, which is set by R and stores the default location for storing user packages. If you create the directory with <pre><code>$ mkdir -p /home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\n</code></pre> then you can print the locations where R is searching for packages (after reloading R), and the default location should appear first in the list. For instance for o Conda installation of R using the Micromamba package manager, the paths printed are <pre><code>&gt; .libPaths()\n[1] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\n[2] \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/micromamba/envs/R/lib/R/library\"\n</code></pre> where R is installed in a Conda environment named <code>R</code> in the second entry of the search path.</p> <p>There are now multiple locations where packages are stored. The location used by default is the first in the list. Thus, after creating the default location for user installed packages, packages are installed by default in user wide mode. For instance, installing the Packrat package, <pre><code>&gt; install.packages(c(\"packrat\"))\n</code></pre> listing the user installation directory <pre><code>$ ls \"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"\npackrat\n</code></pre> will show the directory with the installed Packrat package files. To install the package in a system wide installation, use the <code>lib</code>flag <pre><code>&gt; install.packages(c(\"packrat\"), lib=\"/home/&lt;user name&gt;/micromamba/envs/R/lib/R/library\")\n</code></pre> to specify the installation location. During loading, all directories in the path are searched consecutively until the package is located.</p> <p>The package installation paths can also be used to maintain multiple independent environments in R. For instance, you can maintain a personal environment and project environment for your research group. Lets consider the case where you want the create an environment in a project directory. First, create a directory for the R environment <pre><code>$ mkdir -p \"${PROJECTHOME}&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\"\n</code></pre> where the variable <code>PROJECTHOME</code> is defined in the UL HPC system environment to point to the home of the project directories (and includes a trailing slash '/'). To install a package in the project environment, call the installation function with the appropriate <code>lib</code> argument <pre><code>&gt; install.packages( c(\"packrat\"), lib=paste0( Sys.getenv(\"PROJECTHOME\"), \"&lt;project name&gt;/\", \"R-environment\" ) )\n</code></pre> and follow the typical instructions. To load the package, you now must also specify the location of the library, <pre><code>&gt; library( packrat, lib.loc=paste0( Sys.getenv(\"PROJECTHOME\"), \"&lt;project name&gt;/\", \"R-environment\" ) )\n</code></pre> similar to the installation. Environment options can be used to extent the library paths and avoid having to specify the library path in each command.</p> <p>A startup file mechanism is provided by R to set up user and project wide environment options. There are 2 kinds of file,</p> <ul> <li><code>.Renviron</code> files used to set-up environment variables for R, and</li> <li><code>.Rprofile</code> files used to run any R code during initialization.</li> </ul> <p>Note that <code>.Renviron</code> files are simply a list of <pre><code>key=value\n</code></pre> assignment pairs which are read by R, not proper bash code (adding an <code>export</code> modifier is a syntax error). There are 2 locations where startup files appear,</p> <ul> <li>the home directory, <code>~/.Renviron</code> and <code>~/.Rprofile</code>, for user wide settings, and</li> <li>project directories for project wide settings.</li> </ul> <p>The definitions in project <code>.Rprofile</code> files override the user wide definitions in <code>~/.Rprofile</code>. The definitions in <code>.Renviron</code> files supersede the definitions in <code>~/.Renviron</code>, that is if the project has an environment file, the user wide definitions are ignored. Note that R is designed to source setup files at the directory where R starts, and any setup files in parent or descendent directories are ignored.</p> <p>Both the profile and environment startup files can setup a user wide environment. For instance, to use an environment setup in the project directories of the UL HPC systems add in the user wide environment setup file, <code>~/.Renviron</code>, the entry <pre><code>R_LIBS=${PROJECTHOME}&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\n</code></pre> and then reload R. The new library path is <pre><code>&gt; .libPaths()\n[1] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/projects/&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\"\n[2] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0\"\n[3] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/apps/resif/iris-rhel8/2020b/broadwell/software/R/4.0.5-foss-2020b/lib64/R/library\"\n</code></pre> assuming that all directories appearing in the path exist. Note that the setup file options precede any default options.</p> <p>We can also use startup files to setup project wide libraries. For instance, assume that we are working on a project in a directory named <code>project</code> and the R packages are stored in a subdirectory <code>R-environment</code>. We use a project profile, to still be able to use any library paths defined in the user wide environment file. Add in a file <code>project/.Rprofile</code> the following definitions, <pre><code>project_path &lt;- paste0( getwd(), \"/R-environment\" )\nnewpaths &lt;- c( project_path, .libPaths() )\n.libPaths( newpaths )\n</code></pre> and then start R in the <code>project</code> directory. The new library path is <pre><code>&gt; .libPaths()\n[1] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/Documents/project/R-environment\"\n[2] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/projects/&lt;project name&gt;/R-environment\"\n[3] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0\"\n[4] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/apps/resif/iris-rhel8/2020b/broadwell/software/R/4.0.5-foss-2020b/lib64/R/library\"\n</code></pre> were the local project settings override the user and system wide settings.

Packrat is a light package, so you can install a more modern version in a user wide mode or in some environment accessible to all the users of a UL HPC project.</p> <p>To initialize the project, for instance in the directory <code>~/Documents/project</code>, use the commands: <pre><code>library(packrat)\npackrat::init(\"~/Document/project\")\n</code></pre> The initialization command creates, - a directory <code>~/Document/project/packrat</code> to store the packages, and - a setup script <code>~/Document/project/.Rprofile</code> to initialize the project. Therefore, start R within the project directory <code>~/Document/packrat</code>, to activate the project environment. After initializing the project or whenever you start R in the project directory, the <code>packrat</code> directory and its subdirectories will be the only ones appearing in the library paths: <pre><code>&gt; .libPaths()\n[1] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/Documents/project/packrat/lib/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.0.5\"    [2] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/Documents/project/packrat/lib-ext/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.0.5\"\n[3] \"/mnt/irisgpfs/users/&lt;user name&gt;/Documents/project/packrat/lib-R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.0.5\"\n</code></pre> Execute all package operations as usual.

Environments are effectively system configurations that can be activated and deactivated by the Conda manager, and provide access to a set of packages that are installed in the environment. In the following examples we use the Micromamba package manager, but any other Conda package manager operates with the same commands, as package managers for Conda have the same interface.</p> <p>Environments are created with the command <pre><code>$ micromamba create --name &lt;environment name&gt;\n</code></pre> The environment is then activated with the command <pre><code>$ micromamba activate &lt;environment name&gt;\n</code></pre> anywhere in the file system. To install packages, first ensure that the target environment is active, and then install any required package with the command: <pre><code>$ micromamba install &lt;package name&gt;\n</code></pre> You can specify multiple packages at ones.

Available packages can be found by searching the Anaconda search index or channel specific search indices, such as conda-forge.</p> <p>Specifying package channels</p> <p>The Anaconda index provides instructions for the installation of each package. Quite often the channel is specified in the installation instructions, with options such as <code>conda-forge::&lt;package name&gt;</code> or even <code>-c conda-forge</code> or <code>--channel conda-forge</code>. While the Micromamba installer sets-up <code>conda-forge</code> as the default channel, latter modification in <code>~/.condarc</code> may change the channel priority.
