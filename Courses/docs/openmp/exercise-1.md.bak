#### <u>Parallel Contruct</u>

In this exercise, we will create a parallel region and execute the computational content in parallel.
First, however, this exercise is to create a parallel region and understand the threads' behaviour in parallel.
In later exercises, we will study how to parallelise the computational task within the parallel region.

To create a parallel region, we use the following parallel constructs:

!!! Info "Parallel Contructs"

    === "C/C++"
        ```
        #pragma omp parallel
        ```
    === "FORTRAN"
        ```
        !$omp parllel 
        ```

The above figure illustrates the parallel region behaviour;
as we notice, within the parallel region, we get parallel threads.
This means parallel threads can be executed independently of each other,
and there is no order of execution.

At the same time, in order to enable OpenMP constructs, clauses, and environment variables. etc., we need to include the OpenMP library as follows:

!!! Info "OpenMP library"

    === "C/C++"
        ```
        #include<omp.h>
        ```
    === "FORTRAN"
        ```
        use omp_lib
        ```


#### <u>Compilers</u>

The following copilers would support the OpenMP programming model.

 - [GNU](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - It is an opensource and can be used for Intel and AMD CPUs
 - [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/dpc-compiler.html#gs.zd201n) - It is from Intel and only optimized for Intel CPUs
 - [AOOC](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/pdfs/developer/aocc/aocc-v4.0-ga-user-guide.pdf) - Suitable for AMD CPUs, especially “Zen” core architecture.


!!! Info "Examples (GNU, Intel and AMD): Compilation"

    === "GNU"
        ```c
        $ gcc test.c -fopenmp
        $ g++ test.cc -fopenmp
        $ gfortran test.f90 -fopenmp
        ```

??? Questions

     - What do you notice from those examples? Can you control parallel region printout, that is, how many times it should be printed or executed?     
     - What happens if you do not use the OpenMP library, `#include<omp.h> or use omp_lib`?


Although creating a parallel region would allow us to do the parallel computation, however, at the same time, we should have control over the threads being created in the parallel region, for example, how many threads are needed for a particular computation, thread number, etc. For this, we need to know a few of the important environment routines which are provided by OpenMP. The below list shows a few of the most important environment routines that should be known by the programmer for optimised OpenMP coding.

#### <u>Environment Routines (important)</u>

 - Define number of threads to be used within the parallel region
 
        (C/C++): void omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads);
        (FORTRAN): subroutine omp_set_num_threads(num_threads) 
        integer num_threads

 - To get number of threads in the current parallel region

        (C/C++): int omp_get_num_threads(void);
        (FORTRAN): integer function omp_get_num_threads()

 - To get available maximum threads (system default)

        (c/c++): int omp_get_max_threads(void);
        (FORTRAN): integer function omp_get_max_threads()

 - To get thread numbers (e.g., 1, 4, etc.)

        (c/c+): int omp_get_thread_num(void);
        (FORTRAN): integer function omp_get_thread_num()

 - To know number processors available to the device
 
        (c/c++): int omp_get_num_procs(void);
        (FROTRAN): integer function omp_get_num_procs()


### <u>Questions and Solutions</u>


??? Questions

     - How can you identify the thread numbers within the parallel region?
     - What happens if you not set `omp_set_num_threads()`, for example, `omp_set_num_threads(5)|call omp_set_num_threads(5)`, what do you notice? 
     - Alternatively, you can also set a number of threads to be used in the application while the compilation `export OMP_NUM_THREADS`; what do you see?
